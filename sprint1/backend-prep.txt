1.)Shared Trello cards are:
    -Choose backend stack and initialize project
    -Create base server and one test route
    -Write setup guide for running backend

2.) At this point, I don't think we need to setup any additional software.
Vscode and Mysql should be enough for now.

3.)Choose backend stack and initialize project
   - Create server.js 
   -create code to connect to frontend webpage 

    Create base server and one test route
    -Verify connection to the database 
    -Create test user and information
    -verify test user
    -verify connection to the database

    Write setup guide for running backend
    -Setup guide would include code from the previous cards with 
    descriptive comments so that we can trouble shoot if needed.

4.)Difficulty connecting to the frontend webpage or the database would block us from moving forward
I would need them to set up their part of the frontend and database
