Trello Cards: 
- Convert ERD into Schema
- Create tables and insert test data
- Write core queries for feature 1

STEP 1:
Create a Database by exporting the Relation Schema details to generate schemas and transfering 
it onto MySQL

STEP 2: 
Establish main tables in the database (SubscriberAccount) (External Accounts). Ensuring
that main primary keys and foreign keys are set along with their correct data types 
(INT), (VARCHAR), (CHAR), etc.

STEP 3: 
INSERT mock data to test that tables functioning correctly. This would be done 
by inserting the data manually to check that the there are no errors. 

STEP 4: 
Create the first set of queries that would be used throughout the course of the database.
Queries that identify simple data in the DB like Subscriber count, ORDER subscriber 
by name, track expense count per user, etc

EX:
SELECT *
FROM SubscriberAccount AS S
ORDER BY LName

STEP 5:
Link Database to the LOOT server. From team mates I'll need the server code to link
the DB. Which would include CreateUser, LOGIN code, and adding External Account .

What DONE looks like:
Schemas created for Subscriber Account and External Account with mock data to 
ensure the DB functions correctly. 

Questions & Risks:
What permissions do we need to get access to bank accounts to link 
the external account part of the DB to LOOT.
