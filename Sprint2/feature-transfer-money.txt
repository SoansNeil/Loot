1.) Feature Name- schedule transfers from account to account(personal acc to another acc)
2.)User story- As a user, I want to be able to move money from one account to another account so that money is easily available. 
3.) This adds the value of being confident in being to controll and view where your money is and where it's going.
4.) It touches 
UI: I'd have to add an interface feature for it
Backend:Add scripts to change the database indirectly
Database : make indirect changes.


1.) This solves the problem of allowing the money to be controllable and easily exchanged.
2.)User should see it as a visual feature on their page. 
Clicking it would take the user to their external accounts,
My feature would allow them to transfer money to and from acc. 
3.)- Check database with external accounts 
-create UI feature 
-connect feature on to the server
-connect feature from server to database
-test and make sure everything works

4.) Besides what is mentioned above, API does not need to be changed for my feature.

5.) For this feature, the database would stay the same I would just need to make sure that the amounts are being changed accurately.
Might need to create a new schema to track these changes.
