2.	User Story
Format:
As a user, I want to be able to access certain webpages if I am an employee so that I can view customer accounts and assist them.

•	UI
o	Create webpages that only employees with the correct credentials can access
•	Backend
o	Create route that checks to see if the user is an employee
•	Database
o	Create an employee account table with mock employees
•	External API if applicable
