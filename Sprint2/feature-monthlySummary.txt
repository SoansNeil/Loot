1. Problem statement:
    This feature will save people's time and give them more convenience when it comes to wanting to look
    at overall transactions done over a period of time. For this feature, the summaries will be for expenses done
    over each month and all transactions will be organized by category (bills, food, entertainment, etc).

2. Step by step plan to implement feature:
    1. Create wireframe of what UI will look like for this feature.
    2. Map out new DB changes like ER diagrams for this feature or modify existing ones to fit feature.
    3. Implement new DB changes to actual DB once mapping out is done
    4. Start to implement wireframes to frontend
    5. Create new or modify backend routes to ensure everything about feature works
    6. Once frontend, backend, and DB is finished, starting connecting everything together and test it
