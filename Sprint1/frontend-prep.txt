Responsibilities for sprint 1:
  1. Design and implement base look of website
  2. create navbar
  3. add interactivity between buttons and pages

Set up steps:
  1. look for possible libraries to use to design website with
  2. start to design look of website before starting to code

Development plan:
  1. Once the design of the website is finished, start to code the home page starting with navbar (since this will be on every page)
  2. create html files that will include homepage and other pages the navbar buttons will navigate to (plans page, sign up page, log in page, help page)
  3. Once the base of the homepage is created (with style and interactivity) I will be done for the first sprint. Though if I'm done with my sprint earlier than planned, I want to go
  ahead and start on creating more of the home page (like adding images and descriptions) or start by designing and creating the sign up/login page

Risks or questions:
  1. What I will need from my teammates will be the ER diagram for the sign up part of our project since I will need to know what attributes to add to my sign up html file
  2. Another thing I may need from my teammates is any ideas on what our logo should look like and their opinions on the logos I come up with since the logo will be a big part
  of our website and company
